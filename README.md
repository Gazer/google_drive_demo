This demo app will allow you connect with the user's Google Drive and search for files.

It uses the Google Drive API v3 and Google Sign In in Flutter. The same flow can be used to use any other Google API like Calendar API.

The app was done in a live streaming event on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMwm3oGe6BhJUOrBdfnAEA).
